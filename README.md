# Image-Encryption-based-on-Parallel-Computing

Image-Encryption on a parallel diffusion technique combined with permutation, mentioned in the
research article ”Fast image encryption algorithm based on parallel computing system. Information Sciences”

With this algorithm, the generated encrypted images that reduces the correlation between adjacent pixels to approximately 0.001
